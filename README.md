Ethereum Claymore 11.8 No Fee DevFee Removed

Executable is patched so you don't have to do anything, just start mining.

To make sure everything is working properly check the mining .txt logs for any "eth_submitLogin" where your address doesn't appear. If there are any then restart mining again and it should work properly. Once devfee mining is triggered it will mine to your address instead of developers.
The redirection are done on the fly and do not require stoping or relaunching the mining software.This proxy is placed between Claymore and Internet in order to catch mining fee packet and substituting the devfee address with your wallet address.
